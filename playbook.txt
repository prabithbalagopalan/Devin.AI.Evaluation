## Overview
Your goal is to bootstrap a runnable, production-grade utility application based on a provided Business Requirement Document (BRD). You must establish a modern tech stack, implement core business logic with high mathematical precision, and deliver a polished, responsive UI.

## Procedure
Environment Setup:

Initialize a clean workspace using the technology stack specified in the BRD (Default: React LTS + Tailwind CSS).

Verify the build pipeline and ensure a "Hello World" renders correctly.

Schema & Type Definition:

Analyze the BRD and define TypeScript interfaces/models for all core data entities.

Establish a constants.ts file for all business-logic coefficients (rates, percentages, limits).

Core Logic Implementation:

Create a dedicated, headless logic engine (e.g., calculatePremium.ts or validatePolicy.ts).

Constraint: Logic must be decoupled from the UI to allow for pure unit testing.

UI/UX Componentization:

Build a modular UI based on the functional requirements.

Prioritize Real-time State Updates: User inputs should trigger logic recalculations immediately without page refreshes.

Data Mocking:

If the BRD requires external data, implement fixture-driven mocks or a local JSON-server. Do not leave the app in a broken state waiting for an API.

Quality Assurance:

Unit Tests: Write tests for all edge cases defined in the logic rules (e.g., boundary values, null inputs).

E2E Tests: Implement a basic flow test (e.g., "Changing Input X updates Result Y").

## Advice & Pointers
Modular Design: Keep components small and reusable.

Defensive Coding: Always validate inputs (age, currency, dates) before passing them to the logic engine.

Styling: Use consistent spacing and accessibility standards (ARIA labels).

## Forbidden Actions
No Hardcoding: Do not hardcode business rules inside UI components.

No "Golden Path" Only: Do not submit code without handling at least three common error states (empty fields, invalid characters, out-of-range values).
